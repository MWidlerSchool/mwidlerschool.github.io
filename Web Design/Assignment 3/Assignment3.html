								When not to be receives reproach of being, /
								And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed /
								Not by our feeling but by others' seeing. /
								For why should others' false adulterate eyes /
								Give salutation to my sportive blood? /
								Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, /
								Which in their wills count bad what I think good? /
								No, I am that I am, and they that level /
								At my abuses reckon up their own; /
								I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel. /
								By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown, /
								  Unless this general evil they maintain: /
								  All men are bad, and in their badness reign.<p>
